Guessing-Game
=============

Topic: If I could go anywhere in the world, where would I go?
-Prompt the user for a guess.  Output will be based on whether or not the answer is correct.
-Total of three guesses (use for loop to create this)
-Embed an if/else if/else statement within the for loop to provide different responses to the user based on whether they got the answer correct and whether or not they should try again (the "try again" part of the message was omitted from the final try).
Use a break statement to end the for loop if the user guesses correctly.

Eric was VERY helpful in helping me figure out how to change the responses based on the user input.  More specifically, he suggested I include the "else/if" statement to distinguish the repsonse on the final attempt from the earlier ones.
